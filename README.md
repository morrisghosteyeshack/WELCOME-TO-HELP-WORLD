After been married with two kids, Iâ€™ve become more anxious about how they might be exploited or misused in our new digital world. They are still too young to have social media accounts, but they are actively using our smartphones to watch Youtube and play childrenâ€™s games. Now that you have landed here your life is about to get easier and all the confusion that you have been living in will be over once we do our magic. Cheating spouse investigation or a business partner who looks like doing things behind your back or monitoring your child's mobile phone, whatever your need be we are here to help.There are too many horror stories of both girls and boys, women and men, being exploited online. It can range from identity theft, online shaming, hacking of accounts, stolen images, blackmailing, and more. The victims are often in no position to handle the crime themselves, nor to remove online information that must be removed. It does not help that these crimes are underprioritized by the police. Neither criminals nor online bullies should be allowed to get away with their activities that can seriously damage their victims. Both physically and mentally. Thatâ€™s why Iâ€™ve established Hacked.com to help people in dire situations and to act as a protection agency able to handle cases that the police wonâ€™t prioritize.
